# Minimal Render configuration for repository-based deployment.
# Replace placeholders below (repo, branch, region) with your values before applying.

services:
  - type: web
    name: backend-eventease
    env: docker
    repo: hillary90/backend-eventease    # replace if different
    branch: final-intergration           # replace with the branch you want to deploy (e.g. main)
    plan: starter                        # change to "starter", "standard", etc. as needed
    dockerfilePath: Dockerfile
    buildCommand: ""
    startCommand: ""
    envVars:
      - key: PORT
        value: "8000"
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        # Leave empty here and link to the managed database below or set in Render UI
        value: ""
      - key: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64
        # Mark this value as secure in Render UI. Prefer base64-encoded JSON.
        value: ""
        secure: true

databases:
  - name: eventease-db
    plan: starter
    region: oregon         # replace with your preferred Render region (e.g. oregon)
    postgresVersion: "15"

# Notes:
# - After creating this file in the repository, you can create the service in Render
#   and Render will create the managed Postgres database defined above.
# - In the Render dashboard, set the value for `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` and/or
#   `DATABASE_URL` as secure environment variables for the service.
